## Description
By employing object-oriented programming with Student and Gradebook classes, this section enhances code organization and modularity. This approach encapsulates student information and provides a structured way to add, search, sort, and manage grades.

## Features

Class Design:

Student: Summarizes student information, including name and grades. Provides methods to add new grades and calculate overall and subject-specific averages.
Gradebook: Manages a collection of Student objects. Offers methods to add new students, remove existing students, update student information, search for specific students, and display student records in various formats.

Advanced Operations:
Sort students in ascending or descending order by average grade or by a specific subject's grade.
Add new students to the gradebook, remove existing students, and search for students by name or ID.

Comprehensive Testing:
Thoroughly test the system to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and consistency.
Handle edge cases, such as empty gradebooks, students with no grades, or invalid input.
Optimize the system for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.


## How to Use

- Ensure python is installed in your machine
- Open the Python Section E.py in an IDE (Pycharm or Visual Studio) and run the script
-Create a Gradebook instance and interact with it through methods such as add_student(), remove_student(), sort_by_average(), etc.
